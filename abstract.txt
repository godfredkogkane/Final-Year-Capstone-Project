Title: Optimizing Customer Retention: A Machine Learning Approach to Predicting E-commerce Churn
Authors: Godfred Kogkane

Abstract
The rapid growth of e-commerce has intensified competition, making customer retention a critical priority for businesses. As acquiring new customers remains significantly more costly than retaining existing ones, accurately predicting customer churn has become essential for sustaining profitability. This capstone project investigates and compares the effectiveness of various machine learning (ML) algorithms in predicting customer churn within the e-commerce domain. The study explores a broad range of models, including traditional classifiers (Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors), ensemble methods (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, LightGBM), and deep learning architectures (Convolutional Neural Network and Long Short-Term Memory network), using a structured, feature-rich customer dataset.
Models were evaluated using accuracy, F1 Score, and the Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), with additional computational time and space complexity analysis to assess real-world deployment feasibility. Among all models tested, XGBoost emerged as the best performer, achieving a test accuracy of 98.40%, F1 Score of 0.9516, and MCC of 0.9424, while maintaining efficient training and prediction times. LightGBM and Random Forest also demonstrated strong performance, whereas deep learning models underperformed due to the static and tabular nature of the dataset, highlighting their limited suitability in such contexts.
The study further validated its findings through statistical significance testing and comparative literature analysis, establishing alignment with prior high-impact studies while offering new insights into model performance in class-imbalanced, structured data environments. The results underscore the practical value of ensemble models for customer retention strategies and advocate for model selection approaches that balance predictive accuracy with interpretability and computational efficiency. This work contributes to both academic discourse and industry practice by providing a data-driven roadmap for mitigating churn in the evolving e-commerce landscape.
